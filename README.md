# Guide for the first homework of the cryptography course

This is an assigmnent for the cryptography course. We have to implement a known ciphertext attack + an oracle attack in a client-server model.
We are given the source code of the server, server.py. If we look at it, the server gives us 2 options:
  - get a guest token
  - send a token and verify it

To understand this better, I drew the server-attacker model:

![Attacker model](/crypto_attacker_model1.png)

So, the attacker gets the guest token, which corresponds to the guest user. Then, it generates new tokens, sends them to the server and checks if the server responds with "fail" or "success".

The final purpose is to send a login token to the server such that it responds with "success". In reality, the success message contains a secret flag.

Most of the time, the server will respond with a fail message:

The attacker wants the server to send a success message. If this happens, the attack will be over.

## A depper look into how the token is computed

In order to build an attack, we have to understand how the server encrypts the data. And see if the encryption protocol has a flaw.

The python source code related to how the token is built, looks like this:
```python
def encrypt(self, plain):
        rnd = self.C.encrypt(self.IV)
        cipher = byte_xor(plain, rnd) + SERVER_PUBLIC_BANNER + self.getIntegrity(plain)
        return cipher
```
It is an encrypt function, that receives a plaintext and returns the ciphertext. In our case, the plaintext is a username.

We'll say that our token is the cipher. As you can see, the token is made out of 3 parts:
  - the ecnrypted plaintext
  - a fixed public banner
  - an integrity tag
  
![The internals of the identity token](/secret_token_form.drawio.png)

From e general perspective, the scheme is made such that:
   - generate a unique, secret token for a user
   - a user can request a token corresponding to its username
   - a user can send back the token to prove their identity
   - **a user can't generate a token for another user**

We want to somehow break the last checkpoint. 

## How does the server verify the token

Looking at the drawn attacker model, we see that the server receives a login/identity token from the attacker. Then it verifies it. If it returns true, the server will return "success". So in order to see how we can break the scheme, we need to understand the internals of the verification.

The verification in server.py depends on the decrypt function, that receives a token:
```python
def decrypt(self, input):
        rnd = self.C.encrypt(self.IV)
        secret_len = INTEGRITY_LEN + len(SERVER_PUBLIC_BANNER)
        cipher, secret, tag = input[:-secret_len], input[-secret_len:-INTEGRITY_LEN], input[-INTEGRITY_LEN:]
        plain = byte_xor(cipher, rnd)
        if secret != SERVER_PUBLIC_BANNER:
            return -1
        if self.getIntegrity(plain) != tag:
            return None
Â 
        return plain
```

As we can see, the the server:
  - splits the token in 3
  - it xors the first part with `rnd=E(k, IV)`, which is the same that was used for generating the token
  - it checks if the second part equals to SPB (SERVER_PUBLIC_TOKEN)
  - it computes the integrity of the received plaintext
  - it checks to see if the last part (the integrity tag) equals the computed integrity
  - if the verifications succed, it returns the plaintext
 
![How the server verifies the identity token](/server_token_verification.png)

But this is not all. The plaintext has to have some wanted value. That is the username of the user we want to impersonate. In our case, the server sends a "success" message when the username is "Ephvuln":
```python
def login():
  ...
  plain = C.decrypt(cipher)
  ...
  elif plain == b"Ephvuln":
            print("Secret:", FLAG)
  ...
```

So, we want to generate a token, such that the plaintext/username equals "Ephvuln".

![Scenario: the plaintext is correct. The server returns success](correct_plaintext1.png)

Before breaking this, we'll look at weaker versions of the scheme, and see if we can break them.

## Identity token scheme without encryption
The simplest scheme is just to send the unencrypted username:
```python
def encrypt(self, plain):
        cipher = plain
        return cipher
```

This is trivial to break, because the attacker can just send the target plaintext, "Ephvuln". The server will check that it equals to "Ephvuln" and return the flag.

## Identity token scheme with xor encryption
The following scheme xors the plaintext with a pseudorandom block:
```python
def encrypt(self, plain):
        rnd = self.C.encrypt(self.IV)
        cipher = byte_xor(plain, rnd)
        
        return cipher
```
Pay attention that we're not using the public banner or the integrity tag, yet. This is just a plain xor.

The random block is generated by applying AES on a random string, with a random key. This should be secure, right?

This scheme is basically a OTP. So as long as its used once, we're fine. But in our attack model, the attacker gets a guest token. Then, it can send **other tokens**. Those tokens are decrypted using the same **random block**. THIS IS NOT SECURE!!!

Since the attacker can request the guest token, it means that he has access to a message-ciphertext pair. That is: the encryption of the guest username.
